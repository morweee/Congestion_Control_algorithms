#  ECS 152A Programming Assignment 3 (Fall 2023)
## Congestion Control
Derived from https://github.com/Haroon96/ecs152a-fall-2023/tree/main/week7
### Docker Installation
* [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
* [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

### How to use
(From the `docker` directory).
1. Run `./start-simulator.sh` to start running our receiver with the emulated network profile. Once it's running successfully, you will see a message saying `Receiver running`. 
2. The receiver has already been programmed to send acknowledgements to the sender similar to the receiver in the [discussion](https://github.com/Haroon96/ecs152a-fall-2023/blob/main/week7/docker/receiver.py).
3. Implement your own sender code and bind it to any port other than `5001`. Invoke your sender to send packets to `localhost`, port `5001` to communicate with the receiver.
4. Your sender has to send `-1` as the sequence number  to indicate that it has finished sending data.
5. Invoke your sender.
6. Once the receiver has received the `-1` after receiving all the data, it will terminate.
